## 🔍 About Me

I'm Abdullah Al Siam, a cybersecurity researcher and SOC analyst with a strong foundation in threat detection, incident response, and security operations. With professional experience in tools like Wazuh, CrowdStrike, and ArcSight, I specialize in detecting malicious activity, developing SIEM rules, and managing complex infrastructures across Linux environments.

My research bridges real-world security operations with academic inquiry, focusing on AI-driven cybersecurity solutions, malicious IP detection, and secure medical data handling. I’ve published in IEEE Access (Q1) and other reputable venues, contributing novel frameworks for malware detection and encrypted medical image processing.

## Current Roles and Responsibilities

As an Associate Security Operator at Pathao Pay, I play a key role in ensuring the security and stability of IT infrastructure by:

Monitoring and analyzing real-time security alerts through SIEM platforms to detect anomalies and potential threats.

Managing Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows, including incident triaging, root cause analysis, and timely escalation for resolution.

Collaborating with cross-functional teams to coordinate security responses and strengthen organizational defense mechanisms.

Performing continuous threat hunting and log analysis to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) and minimize security gaps.

Documenting incident reports and response actions, contributing to improved threat intelligence and response playbooks.

Ensuring compliance with internal security policies and supporting audits with data-driven security metrics.

## 🛡️ Research Focus

AI-Driven Threat Detection: Designing and evaluating machine learning models to identify malicious IPs, detect anomalies, and respond to zero-day threats in real-time.

Secure Medical Data Handling: Developing algorithms for DICOM image encryption and format conversion (e.g., EGIF, JPEG 2000) to ensure data confidentiality in AI/ML pipelines.

Cyber Threat Intelligence: Investigating advanced techniques for analyzing threat landscapes, malicious behaviors, and attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

Defensive Security Automation: Building scalable frameworks for SOC operations, integrating SIEM/EDR tools with automated alert handling and response logic.
