## Current Roles and Responsibilities

As an **Associate Security Operator** at **Pathao Pay**, I have:

🔍**Strengthened Threat Detection** – Optimized SIEM alert tuning and analysis, improving anomaly detection accuracy and reducing false positives by streamlining alert workflows.

⚡**Enhanced SOC Efficiency**– Led incident triaging processes that cut average response time, enabling faster containment and remediation of threats.

🤝 **Coordinated Critical Incident Responses** – Collaborated with cross-functional teams to resolve high-priority security events with minimal downtime and zero data loss.

🕵 **Advanced Threat Hunting Capabilities** – Identified and mitigated multiple Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) through proactive log analysis, preventing potential breaches.

📄 **Improved Incident Intelligence** – Authored detailed incident reports and updated response playbooks, strengthening the organization’s defense strategies.

✅**Supported Compliance & Audits** – Successfully met internal security compliance benchmarks and facilitated audits with comprehensive security metrics and documentation.

## 🛡️ Research Focus

**🔍 AI-Driven Threat Detection** – Designed and evaluated machine learning models to identify malicious IPs, detect anomalies, and respond to zero-day threats in real time, boosting proactive defense.

**🛡 Secure Medical Data Handling** – Developed algorithms for DICOM image encryption and format conversion (EGIF, JPEG 2000) to ensure confidentiality in AI/ML medical imaging workflows.

**🌐 Cyber Threat Intelligence** – Investigated advanced techniques for analyzing threat landscapes, malicious behaviors, and attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

**⚙ Defensive Security Automation** – Built scalable SOC automation frameworks integrating SIEM/EDR tools with intelligent alert handling and automated response logic.
